## Problem Statement
Police scanner codes have been around for over half a decade. They were originally created to limit speech on emergency radios, making it easier to transmit messages efficiently as well as prevent unwanted listeners from knowing what is going on. They originally started as a small list of basic commands but over the years have grown into a longer more standardized list of over 150 different translations relating to many events which help keep messages brief.

Our problem is trying to figure out what these codes mean. There are many ways to listen to emergency scanners through CB radios or other radio transmitters, making it easy for anybody to hear what kind of emergencys are going on in their area or across the country, but with the scanner codes are still used trying to interpret what is actually happenening can be a bit of a hassle. We have created service that will take any emergency code and translate it to what it means.
